## Expression Evaluation
The program evaluates an arithmetic expression using Recursion and Stacks. 
# Testing
Running the Evaluator driver calls methods in Expression. There are two ways of testing:
1. Enter any expressions for the evaluation.
```
Enter the expression, or hit return to quit -> 3-4*5
Enter Symbol values file name, or hit return if no symbols -> 
Value of expression = 3.0
Enter the expression, or hit return to quit ->
```
2. Create own symbol values files(e.g. etest1.txt) for further testing and try loading the value from them.
```
Enter the expression, or hit return to quit -> a
Enter Symbol values file name, or hit return if no symbols -> etest1.txt
Value of expression = 3.0 
Enter the expression, or hit return to quit ->
```
